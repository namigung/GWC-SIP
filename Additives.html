      <p> The U.S. takes a more reactive approach to regulating food and beverage ingredients. Only additives proved to be non-harmful are approved in Europe, while food additives are innocent until proven guilty Ingredients that are illegal in Europe are often used in the United States such as Ractopamine, Potassium bromate, Olestra, and Azodicarbonamide.Azodicarbonamide is a known carcinogen, or cancer-causing agent, that allows bread to stay soft and spongy longer. It is also used to inject bubbles in yoga mat and flip-flops.Potassium bromate has been found to increase benign and malignant tumors in the thyroid and causes significant increases in cancer of animals’ kidneys. American food companies produce healthier version of their products overseen, with many of potentially harmful additives removed when their products are to be sold oversees. </p>

  “Over 275,000 women are or will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year in the US, and most cases have nothing to do with family history. Science has shown that our exposure to toxic chemicals plays a big role; especially because we are constantly exposed to a mixture of chemicals that impact our health. So it’s essential that the FDA fully follow and implement the law when it comes to something as basic and important as the safety of a mixture of chemicals in our food.” — Lisette van Vliet, Senior Policy Coordinator, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners.The combination and constant consumption of potentially harmful chemicals add up overtime. The FDA allows manufacturers to self certify that foods are safe, which causes the public to be largely unknown of the true saftey of food consumption. Negative hormonal, neurological and organ effects and cancer have been connected to many of the additives that the FDA has deemed safe.
