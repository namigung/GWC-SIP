      <h3>What Can You Do?</h3>
      <p>Join the petition with American Academy of Pediatric, American Public Health Association, Breast Cancer Prevention partners and other organization to petition the FDA to make changes to its regulations and procedures. Citizens should demand higher food quality, which will force companies and manufacturers to meet these demands. Boycott highly processed foods with additives-- only by decreasing company profits would change occur.
For example, BPA in hard plasticcan potentially affect the brain of fetuses and cause cancer. Consumer action against BPA such as boycott has already pressured many companies to stray from using it. This same action can be done with other things such as Food Dyes
